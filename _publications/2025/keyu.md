abstract: >-
  Network side-channel attacks, such as SADDNS enabling off-path cache poisoning, are notoriously difficult to detect because current automated techniques require extensive, error-prone modeling that oversimplifies network protocols. In response, we introduce SCAD—the first solution leveraging dynamic symbolic execution to efficiently identify non-interference violations across multiple execution traces—uncovering previously unknown vulnerabilities with significantly reduced manual effort.
